New Features for AWSOM Pixgallery 4.5.X:

NEW FEATURES:

1) Legacy Mode setting--Allows Pixgallery to use the pre 4.5.X caption system until all captions are updated to the new system.

2) Individual Commenting system--Allows the admin to have comments sticky to images and folders.

3) New Sorting Options: Numerical sort. Now you can assign a number to each image which will then sort based on this within a folder. Sub
galleries may also be assigned a number.

4) New workflow speed increase: Now you can edit or delete galleries and captions from the "view all" screens.

5) New workflow speed increase: Round trip linking now available when editing or adding captions from the website view. Once
your caption is added a link appears to return you to the image/gallery page you came from.

6) New workflow speed increase: Galleries and Folders may now be edited from the website view.

7) Some test code added to hopefully help with the Windows IIS permalinks problems that have been reported.

8) Added in new Watermark option using .gif files to make transparent overlays possible.

9) Added "Delete all Cache Files" function on the Write-->Pixgallery Image Captions page to help when resetting thumbnail or
watermark options.

10) Optional EXIF and IPTC data now visible to visitors with admin option to turn this on or off.

11) Added in Debug mode to make it easier to determine why some issues pop up. Also makes it easier to see the sort order numbers attached to images in the
thumbnail view.

12) Added in new ability to turn off the built in javascript functions and add in custom 3rd party effects code (lightbox, etc).

13) Added in new ability to limit the number of pagination links on the thumbnail view page to work better with some themes.

14) Added in new CSS entry "PxgSubGaleryImage" to help differentiate subfolder images in thumbnail view when title text is turned off.

15) Added in new Viewcount system for images. Now the Admin can track how many times each image has been viewed. Note: This requires
an image to have a caption entry in the database. Images without caption entries will not be tracked.

KNOWN ISSUES:


1) Pasting the code into a page or post generated by AWSOM Pixgallery from the Manage Galleries page for a Gallery using the Visual editor does not
function properly. This is due to the fact that the editor does not like directly input "HTML' code (which the pixgallery code mimics). Switch to the Code editor, paste the code, then switch back to the Visual editor and it will work properly.

2) Due to a change in WordPress 2.6 in regard to default "uploads" folder path settings and other path related changes the Default gallery path that
Pixgallery creates has now been set to simply be "/wp-content/uploads/awsompixgallery/" at plugin activation time. It would have been a real pain
to actually try to determine where this had been moved to (if it had) as well as compensate in other areas of the code. If you have moved your
default wp-content location you will need to edit this through the Manage Pixgallery Galleries admin page if you wish to use the default folder. Since
probably 99% of you guys won't actually move your wp-content folder (and there are many good reasons not to do so) I'm not too worried by this since the
few of you who do move it will easily be able to edit this setting since you are probably a more advanced WordPress user anyway.
