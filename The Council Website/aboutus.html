		  <h1>About Us</h1>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
		  <p>The National Council for Agricultural Education (The Council) strives to stimulate positive growth in agricultural education. Since its beginning in December 1983, The Council has provided leadership for stakeholders in agriculture, food, fiber and natural resources systems education.</p>
		  <p>It strives to surface issues important to agricultural education and stimulate actions to support those issues.</p>
		  <p>The Council serves as a common meeting ground for agricultural education and represents organizations and entities representing students, teachers, teacher educators, state leaders, alumni, industry, and government.</p>
		  <p class="last_p">The Council promotes success for students and teachers who participate in the formal agricultural education instructional programs offered in grades seven through adult throughout the 50 states and three U.S. territories.</p>
