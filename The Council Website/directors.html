He worked as a farmhand for his neighbors, was active in both 4H and FFA and eventually went to Purdue University, where he obtained his degree in agronomy. Later, Vern earned an executive master's degree in business administration from Temple University. He began his career as a college intern for a Syngenta legacy company, ICI Americas, more than 25 years ago.<br /><br />

He also spent time leading the U.S. Horticulture Business Unit. In addition to these positions, he has been at the helm of Syngenta Brand Management, Biological Research and Development, Regulatory Affairs and Development Planning teams in the NAFTA Region. Before Syngenta was formed, Vern was the global business manager for pyrethroid insecticides with Zeneca Agrochemicals based in the United Kingdom.<br /><br />
