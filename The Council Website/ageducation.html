		  <h1>About Agricultural Education </h1>
		  <h3><strong>Overview</strong>		  </h3>
		  <p>Agricultural             education is a systematic program of instruction available to   students desiring to learn about the science, business, and   technology of plant           and animal production and/or about the   environmental and natural resources           systems. Agricultural   education first became a part of the public education           system   in 1917 when the U.S. Congress passed the Smith-Hughes Act.             Today, over 800,000 students participate in formal agricultural   education           instructional programs offered in grades seven-adult   throughout the           50 states and three U. S. territories. </p>

		  <h3><strong>Opportunities</strong></h3>
<p>Students             are provided opportunities for leadership development,   personal growth,           and career success. Agricultural education   instruction is delivered           through three major components: 1)   classroom/laboratory instruction           (contextual learning), 2)   supervised agricultural experience programs           (work-based   learning), and 3) student leadership organizations (National             FFA Organization, National Young Farmer Educational Association, and             National Postsecondary Agricultural Student Organization).</p>
          <hr class="last" />
          <h3><strong>Organizations</strong></h3>
          <p>Nationally,             eleven organizations serve agricultural education. They are:   Agricultural           Education Division of the Association for Career   and Technical Education,           American Association for Agricultural   Education, National Association           of Agricultural Educators,   National Council for Agricultural Education,           National   Association of Supervisors of Agricultural Education, National             FFA Alumni Association, National FFA Foundation, Inc., National FFA             Organization, National Postsecondary Agricultural Student   Organization,           National Farm and Ranch Business Management   Education Association,           and National Young Farmer Educational   Association.</p>
          <hr class="last" />
          <h3><strong>Structure</strong></h3>
          <p>Agricultural             education instruction is provided at the local level through   the nation's           schools. State leadership is provided through   various agencies and           institutions including state departments   of education, state departments           of agriculture, land grant   universities, community colleges, and other           entities. The U.   S. Department of Education provides federal leadership.           All of   the agricultural education organizations have local, state,             and national programs and activities. The umbrella organization for             the agricultural education community is the National Council for   Agricultural           Education (The Council). </p>
